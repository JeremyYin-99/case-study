            "message": "Here\u2019s a comprehensive guide to troubleshoot and fix your **Whirlpool fridge ice maker** that\u2019s not working, based on PartSelect's blog:\n\n### Quick Fixes to Try First:\n1. **Check the Shutoff Arm/Switch**:\n   - Ensure the shutoff arm or switch (located near the ice bin) is not accidentally set to \"OFF.\" Adjust it to the correct position.\n\n2. **Empty the Ice Bin**:\n   - If the ice bin is frozen or compacted, remove all ice and clean the bin to allow proper ice production.\n\n3. **Adjust Freezer Temperature**:\n   - The freezer should be at **0\u00b0F (-18\u00b0C)** or slightly colder. Use a thermometer to verify and adjust the temperature settings if needed.\n\n4. **Thaw Frozen Water Supply**:\n   - If the water supply tube is frozen, use a hair dryer (on low heat) to gently thaw it. Avoid direct heat to prevent melting plastic.\n\n### Deeper Troubleshooting:\n5. **Inspect Ejector Fingers**:\n   - If the ice maker's ejector fingers (or paddles) are jammed, manually break up any ice blocking them.\n\n6. **Check Water Supply Tube**:\n   - Ensure the water tube isn\u2019t clogged or kinked. A blocked tube will stop water flow to the ice maker.\n\n7. **Verify Infrared Sensor (if applicable)**:\n   - Some models use infrared sensors to detect ice levels. Clear any ice buildup around the sensor to restore functionality.\n\n### Parts to Examine and Replace:\n8. **Replace the Water Filter**:\n   - A clogged or old water filter can restrict water flow. Replace it every **6\u20139 months** with an OEM filter.\n\n9. **Test the Door Switch**:\n   - A faulty door switch can disable the ice maker. If the fridge light works but the ice maker doesn\u2019t, replace the switch.\n\n10. **Inspect the Water Inlet Valve**:\n    - A malfunctioning valve can stop water flow. Replace it if you notice weak water pressure or no ice production.\n\n11. **Check the Ice Dispenser Actuator**:\n    - If ice is made but not dispensed, the actuator (paddle) might be broken and need replacement.\n\n### If All Else Fails:\n- If the ice maker still doesn\u2019t work, the issue might be with the **control board**, which may require professional repair.\n\n### Safety Tips:\n- Always **unplug the fridge** before inspecting or replacing parts.\n- Use **OEM parts** for replacements to ensure compatibility.\n\nFor detailed step-by-step guides or to purchase replacement parts, visit [PartSelect's blog](https://www.partselect.com/blog/fix-broken-refrigerator-ice-maker/).
