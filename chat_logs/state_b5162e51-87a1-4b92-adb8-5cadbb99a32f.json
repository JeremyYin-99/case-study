            "message": "The part number **PS11752778** is a **Refrigerator Door Shelf Bin** manufactured by Whirlpool (compatible with Whirlpool, Kenmore, Maytag, and KitchenAid models). Here's how you can install it:\n\n### Installation Steps:\n1. **Remove the Old Bin**:\n   - If the old bin is still in place, simply grab it with both hands and lift it away from the door. It should come off easily.\n\n2. **Install the New Bin**:\n   - Align the new bin with the slots or guides on the refrigerator door.\n   - Gently press or snap it into place. No tools are required for this installation.\n\n3. **Verify Fit**:\n   - Ensure the bin is securely attached and sits flush with the door.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The installation is tool-free and typically takes less than 15 minutes.\n- The bin is designed to fit many side-by-side refrigerator models, but always verify your refrigerator\u2019s model number before ordering to ensure compatibility.\n\nIf you encounter any issues or need further assistance, feel free to ask!

            "message": "Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to troubleshoot and fix your Whirlpool refrigerator\u2019s ice maker based on PartSelect's blog:\n\n### Quick Fixes to Try First:\n1. **Check the Shutoff Arm/Switch**:\n   - Ensure the shutoff arm or switch (often located near the ice bin) is not accidentally set to \"OFF.\" Move it to the \"ON\" position if needed.\n\n2. **Empty the Ice Bin**:\n   - If the ice bin is frozen or compacted, remove all ice and clean the bin to allow the ice maker to function properly.\n\n3. **Adjust Freezer Temperature**:\n   - The freezer should be at or below **0\u00b0F (-18\u00b0C)**. Use a thermometer to verify and adjust the temperature settings if necessary.\n\n4. **Thaw the Water Supply Tube**:\n   - If the water supply tube is frozen, use a hairdryer (on low heat) to gently thaw it. Avoid direct heat to prevent melting plastic.\n\n### Advanced Troubleshooting:\n5. **Inspect the Ejector Fingers**:\n   - If the ice maker produces ice but doesn\u2019t eject it, check for jammed ejector fingers (also called paddles or tines). Clear any ice blocking them.\n\n6. **Check the Water Supply**:\n   - Ensure the water supply tube isn\u2019t kinked or clogged. A blocked tube will stop ice production.\n\n7. **Test the Infrared Sensor (if applicable)**:\n   - Some models use infrared sensors to detect ice levels. If dislodged or blocked, reposition or clean the sensor.\n\n### Part Replacements (If Needed):\n8. **Replace the Water Filter**:\n   - A clogged or after-market water filter can restrict water flow. Replace it with an OEM filter every 6\u20139 months.\n\n9. **Check the Door Switch**:\n   - If the door switch is faulty, the ice maker may not activate. Test or replace the switch if the fridge light doesn\u2019t turn on when the door opens.\n\n10. **Inspect the Water Inlet Valve**:\n    - A faulty water inlet valve can stop water from reaching the ice maker. Replace it if water pressure is weak or nonexistent.\n\n11. **Fix the Ice Dispenser Actuator**:\n    - If ice isn\u2019t dispensing, the actuator (paddle) might be broken. Replace it to restore functionality.\n\n### Final Steps:\n- If none of the above works, the issue might be with the refrigerator\u2019s control board, which may require professional assistance.\n\nFor detailed instructions or video guides, visit the [PartSelect blog](https://www.partselect.com/blog/fix-broken-refrigerator-ice-maker/).
