            "message": "Here\u2019s a comprehensive guide to troubleshoot and fix your **Whirlpool fridge ice maker** based on PartSelect's blog:\n\n### Common Causes and Quick Fixes:\n1. **Check the Shutoff Arm/Switch**:\n   - Ensure the shutoff arm or switch (usually near the ice bin) is in the \"ON\" position. If accidentally turned off, it stops ice production.\n\n2. **Empty the Ice Bin**:\n   - If the bin is full or the ice is compacted, the ice maker may stop working. Remove old ice and reset the bin.\n\n3. **Adjust Freezer Temperature**:\n   - The freezer should be at **0\u00b0F (-18\u00b0C)** or slightly colder. Use a thermometer to verify and adjust the temperature settings if needed.\n\n4. **Thaw Frozen Water Supply**:\n   - If the water supply tube is frozen, use a hair dryer (on low heat) to gently thaw it. Avoid direct heat to prevent melting plastic.\n\n### Advanced Troubleshooting:\n5. **Inspect the Ejector Fingers**:\n   - These mechanisms push ice into the bin. If jammed, manually break up any stuck ice to free them.\n\n6. **Check the Water Supply Tube**:\n   - Ensure the tube isn\u2019t kinked or clogged. A blocked tube prevents water from reaching the ice maker.\n\n7. **Verify the Infrared Sensor (if applicable)**:\n   - Some models use sensors to detect ice levels. Clear any ice buildup around the sensor to restore functionality.\n\n### Part Replacements (If Needed):\n8. **Replace the Water Filter**:\n   - A clogged filter can block water flow. Replace it every **6\u20139 months** with an OEM filter (check compatibility for your model).\n\n9. **Test the Door Switch**:\n   - If the switch is faulty, the ice maker won\u2019t activate. Replace it if the light doesn\u2019t turn on when the door opens.\n\n10. **Inspect the Water Inlet Valve**:\n    - A faulty valve can reduce water pressure. Replace it if the dispenser has weak flow.\n\n11. **Check the Ice Dispenser Actuator**:\n    - If ice isn\u2019t dispensing, the actuator (paddle) might be broken. Replace it to restore functionality.\n\n### Final Steps:\n- After repairs, allow **24 hours** for the ice maker to start producing ice again.\n- If issues persist, the problem might be with the **control board**, requiring professional assistance.\n\nFor visual guides or part replacements, visit the [PartSelect blog](https://www.partselect.com/blog/fix-broken-refrigerator-ice-maker/).

            "message": "Here\u2019s a detailed guide to fixing a leaky refrigerator, based on PartSelect's blog:\n\n### Common Causes of a Leaky Refrigerator:\n1. **Faulty Door Seal**:\n   - A torn or dirty door seal can allow warm air to enter, causing condensation and leaks.\n   - **Solution**: Clean the seal with mild detergent and warm water. If torn, repair it temporarily with silicone glue or replace it entirely.\n\n2. **Clogged Defrost Drain**:\n   - Water from the defrost cycle may leak if the drain is clogged with debris.\n   - **Solution**: Locate the drain (usually at the back of the freezer) and clear it using warm water or a pipe cleaner.\n\n3. **Water Supply Line Issues**:\n   - A cracked or loose water line (for ice makers or dispensers) can leak.\n   - **Solution**: Inspect the line for damage and tighten connections or replace the line if necessary.\n\n4. **Overfilled Drain Pan**:\n   - The drain pan collects excess water. If it overflows, water may leak.\n   - **Solution**: Check the pan (located under the fridge) and empty it if full.\n\n5. **Improper Leveling**:\n   - If the fridge isn\u2019t level, water may not drain properly.\n   - **Solution**: Adjust the leveling legs to ensure the fridge tilts slightly backward.\n\n### Step-by-Step Fixes:\n#### 1. **Check the Door Seal**:\n   - Perform the \"dollar bill test\" to check for gaps.\n   - Clean the seal or replace it if damaged.\n\n#### 2. **Unclog the Defrost Drain**:\n   - Pour warm water down the drain to melt ice or use a pipe cleaner to remove debris.\n\n#### 3. **Inspect the Water Supply Line**:\n   - Turn off the water supply and check for cracks or loose connections.\n   - Replace the line if damaged.\n\n#### 4. **Empty the Drain Pan**:\n   - Slide out the pan and empty it. Clean it to prevent mold.\n\n#### 5. **Level the Refrigerator**:\n   - Use a level tool to adjust the front legs so the fridge tilts slightly backward.\n\n### Additional Tips:\n- **Regular Maintenance**: Clean the door seal and defrost drain periodically.\n- **Monitor Temperature**: Ensure the fridge is set to the correct temperature (37\u201340\u00b0F for the fridge, 0\u00b0F for the freezer).\n\nIf the leak persists after these steps, the issue might involve internal components like the evaporator or water inlet valve, which may require professional assistance.\n\nFor more details, refer to the [PartSelect blog](https://www.partselect.com/blog/how-to-fix-a-torn-refrigerator-door-seal/).
